## What is Buzz?

Buzz is a fun project started while playing the [Lord of the Rings drinking game](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/the-lord-of-the-rings) (drink at certain scenes version) during the [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns). As much fun as it is yelling "DRINK" on Discord, needing to unmute every time became quite the hastle. Buzz was conceived in an attempt to fix this problem... With Buzz you can smash any key on your keyboard to alert all of your friends to drink! Virtual drinking games are now just as satisfying as the oh-so nestolgic real-life drinking games.
